in

such

have
seemed
perfectly
compatible
with
the
altered
mood
ajax.
he
has
come
to
see
that
he
erred
in
his
over--eening
selfreliance;
he

he

maxim.
now
and
again
a
higher
thical
yeaching
declares
that
the
just
man
will
not
knowingly
injure
any

but

view,

striking
parallel
to
the
case
of
ajax
here
is
presented
by
that
of
oedipus
at
colonus.
oedipus
has
found
rest
and
peace
at
the

the
he

is

he
is

ajax-to
consecration
as
heroπ
and
it
is
in
these
circumstances
that
he
utters
the
appalling
imprecations
on
his
sons.
still,
in
one
respect
the
vindictiveness
of
ajax
must
appear
monstrous

invokes
