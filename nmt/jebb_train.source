INTRODUCTION.
1.
AMONG
the
plays
of
Sophocles
there
were
many,
as
titles
and
fragments
show,
of
which
the
scene
was
laid
at
Troy,
and
of
which
the
action
was
founded
on
the
epics
of
the
Trojan
cycle.
This
series
ranged
over
the
whole
course
of
the
ten
years’
from
its
earliest
incidents,
as
told
in
the
Cypria,
down
to
the
fall
of
city,
as
told
in
the
Jliupersis.
The
Phliloctetes
is
con-
nected
with
this
series,
but
the
Ajax
is
the
only
remaining
piece
which
actually
belongs
to
it.
The
story
is
taken
from
sources
later
than
the
//iad,
but
the
conception
of
the
hero,
though
modified
by
that
later
legend,
is
fundamentally
Homeric.
In
the
/Jliad,
Ajax,
the
son
of
Telamon,
comes
to
Troy
The
Ajax
from
Salamis
with
twelve
ships,
and
is
stationed
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
army,
at
the
east
end
of
the
camp,—as
Achilles
holds
the
corresponding
post
of
honour
on
the
right’.
He
is
an
independent
chief,—subject
only
to
the
allegiance
which
all
the
chiefs
owe
to
the
Captain
General,
Agamemnon.
There
is
no
reference
to
his
descent
from
Aeacus;
nor
is
there
anything
that
connects
him
especially
with
Athens’
He

In
the
Catalogue
only
two
verses
are
given
to
Ajax,

The
second
verse
is
absent
from
our
best
Mss.,
as
it
was
from
some
of
the
editions
known
to
Quintilian
(5.
11

Aristotle
1.

§
13)
alludes
to
it
as
having
been
quoted
by
the
Athenians
in
support
of
their
claim
to
Salamis,
and
the
inter-
polation
must
be
at
least
old
as
the
date
of
their
controversy
with
the
Megarians
(circ.
όοο---595
B.C.),
whether
the
author
was
Solon
or
not.
The
Alexandrian
critics
rejected
the
verse,
pointing
out
that
Ajax,
on
the
extreme
left,
had
the
Thessalians
for
AlAZ
do
I
hear
thy
and
seize
it
in
my
soul,
as
when
a
Tyrrhenian
clarion
speaks
from
mouth
of
bronze!
And
now
thou
hast
dis-
cerned
aright
that
I
am
hunting
to
and
fro
on
the
trail
of
foeman,
even
Ajax
of
the
mighty
shield.
Tis
he,
and
no
that
I
have
been
tracking
so
long.
This
night
he
hath
done
to
us
thing
which
passes
thought,
—if
he
is
indeed
the
for
we
know
nothing
certain,
but
drift
in
and
took
upon
me
the
burden
of
this
search.
We
have
lately
found
the
cattle,
our
spoil,
dead—yea,
slaughtered
by
human
hand—and
dead,
beside
them,
the
guardians
of
the
flocks.
Now,
all
men
lay
this
crime
to
him.

Similarly

by
Plato
(Crat.

while
the
earliest
authority
for

is

In
tragic
iambics

naturally
preferred,
on
metrical
grounds,
to
ἐθέλω,
though
the
latter
occurs

If

were
found
in

where

of
the
form
would
not
justify
its
rejection.
But
where,
as

not
the

as
drawn

is
apt
to
feel
with
the
‘suicide

Ajax,
the
principal
interest
has
dis-
appeared.
Modern
criticism
has
suggested
various
apologies
for
the
latter
part
of
the
play;
the
supreme
importance
which
the
ancient
Greeks
attached
to
funeral
rites,
as
affecting
the
condition
of
the
departed
spirit;
the
advantage
incidental
to
the
controversy
between
Teucer
and
the
Atreidae,
that
the
merits
of
Ajax
are
triumphantly
the
edifying
victory
of
prudence
and
magnanimity
in
the
person
of
Odysseus.
All
such
con-
siderations,
however,
tend
only
to
show,
first,
that
this
part
of
the
play
would
have
been
interesting,
on
general
grounds,
to
Greek
audience;
and
secondly,
that
it
is
not
irrelevant
to
the
subject
of
the
earlier
portion.
But
more
than
this
is
required,
if
the
sequel
to
the
hero's
death
is
to
be
justified
as
matter
of
dramatic
art.
