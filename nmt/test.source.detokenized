IMPRECAT/ION

xxxix
In
the
final
soliloquy
of
Ajax,
his
change
of
mood
is
His
im-
obscured
by
another
sentiment
which
moderns
might
think
inconsistent
with
it,—viz.,
his
fierce
vindictiveness
towards
those
(reeks.
who
had
given
the
award
of
the
arms
against
him
(vv.
835
ff.)
And

them

miserable
life

they

and

To
the
ancients,
however,
such
utterances
would
have
seemed
perfectly
compatible
with
the
altered
mood
Ajax.
He
has
come
to
see
that
he
erred
in
his
over-weening
self-
reliance;
he
‘yields
to
the
gods,’
and
acknowledges
that
the
office
of
human
rulers
claims
respect:
but
he
also
feels
im-
placable
resentment
for
wrong.
‘Benefit
thy
friends
and
hurt
thy
foes,’
was
the
received
Greek
maxim.
Now
and
again
a
higher
ethical
teaching
declares
that
the
just
man
will
not
knowingly
injure
any
one’.
But
man
might
be
morally
good,
in
the
ordinary
Greek
view,
and
also
pious
(εὐσεβής),
without
accepting
that
doctrine:
Solon,
who
was
esteemed
both,
prays
that
he
may
be
to
his
friends
and
bitter
to
his
foes*’;
Pindar,
pre-eminently
religious
poet,
who
speaks
as
with
the
voice
of
Delphi,
expresses
like
sentiment®.
striking
parallel
to
the
case
of
Ajax
here
is
presented
by
that
of
Oedipus
at
Colonus.
Oedipus
has
found
rest
and
peace
at
the
shrine
of
the
he
has
been
reconciled
with
the
gods;
he
is
already
invested
with
kind
of
sanctity;
he
is
on
his
way—
like
Ajax—to
consecration
as
hero:
and
it
is
in
these
circum-
stances
that
he
utters
the
appalling
imprecations
on
his
sons.
Still,
in
one
respect
the
vindictiveness
of
Ajax
must
appear
monstrous
he
invokes
destruction,
not
only
on
the
chiefs,
but
